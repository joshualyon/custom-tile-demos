## For Developers

Building your own custom tiles? Start here:

### üìö Official Documentation
- **[Custom Tiles Overview](https://docs.sharptools.io/developer-tools/custom-tiles/html)** - Core concepts and getting started
- **[stio Library Reference](https://docs.sharptools.io/developer-tools/custom-tiles/stio-lib)** - API documentation

### üîç Reference Implementations

Learn from these examples in the repository:

#### Modern Approach (Recommended)
- **`/html-attribute/`** - THING and THING:ATTRIBUTE:NAME settings
- **`/gauges/thingGaugeJS.html`** - VARIABLE integration with gauge visualization
- **`/vertical-range-input/`** - Advanced features including:
  - Capability filters for device selection
  - *Undocumented*: Conditional settings using `showIf` (use at your own risk)

#### UI Components
- **`/gauges/`** - Complex visualizations with ApexCharts and GaugeJS
- **`/analog-clock/`** - Animated SVG elements
- **`/sunrise-sunset/`** - External API integration

#### Platform Integrations (Fallback Approach)
- **`/he-maker-api-html/`** - Hubitat Maker API (when THING access isn't sufficient)
- **`/smartthings-scenes/`** - SmartThings API with Personal Access Tokens
- **`/homey/`** - Multiple Homey integration methods

```

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Tips

1. **Use Modern Approach**: Prefer THING/VARIABLE settings over direct API integration
2. **Test Broadly**: Verify functionality across different browsers and devices
3. **Handle Errors**: Implement user-friendly error messages (see examples)
4. **Follow Patterns**: Review existing tiles for coding conventions
5. **Check CLAUDE.md**: Internal development guidelines and patterns

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Custom tiles run in a sandboxed environment
- Always validate user inputs and handle missing configurations
- Some features shown in examples (like `showIf`) are undocumented and may change
- Place settings schema at the end of your HTML file
