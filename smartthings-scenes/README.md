This is a proof-of-concept for controlling SmartThings Scenes. 

## Setup
In order to use the tile, you will need to create a SmartThings '[Personal Access Token](https://account.smartthings.com/tokens)' with access to 
Scenes and use it for the 'token' setting in the tile. When configuring the token, make sure to check the boxes next to the Scenes permissions:  
* See all scenes
* Control this scene
